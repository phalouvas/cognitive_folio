# Cognitive Folio - Structured Financial Data Implementation

This document tracks the migration from JSON blob storage to structured CF Financial Period DocType for financial statement data. This enables better AI analysis, historical tracking, and data quality management.

## Context

Previously, financial data from Yahoo Finance was stored as JSON blobs in Long Text fields (profit_loss, balance_sheet, cash_flow). This made it difficult for AI to access data consistently and impossible to track history or compare companies effectively.

The new **CF Financial Period** DocType stores financial data in structured fields with automatic calculations for margins, ratios, and YoY growth. It supports multiple data sources (Yahoo Finance, PDF uploads, manual entry) with a conflict resolution system that prioritizes higher-quality sources.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

#### Task 1.1: Create CF Financial Period DocType ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Details:** 
- Created `/cognitive_folio/doctype/cf_financial_period/` with JSON, Python, JS, and test files
- Fields include: security link, period identification (fiscal_year, quarter, type), income statement (revenue, expenses, income), balance sheet (assets, liabilities, equity), cash flow (operating, investing, financing), computed metrics (margins, ratios), growth metrics (YoY comparisons)
- Auto-naming: `{security}-{period_type}-{fiscal_year}-{fiscal_quarter}`
- Automatic calculation of margins (gross, operating, net), ratios (ROE, ROA, debt/equity, current, quick), YoY growth when previous period exists

#### Task 1.2: Add Smart Conflict Resolution ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Details:**
- Added fields: `override_yahoo` (checkbox to lock data), `data_quality_score` (auto-calculated: Manual=100, PDF=95, SEC=90, Yahoo=85), `verified_by_pdf` (attachment to source document)
- Created `get_source_priority()` function to rank data sources
- Created `check_import_conflicts()` function to detect existing higher-quality periods before import
- Modified `import_from_yahoo_finance()` to accept `replace_existing` and `respect_override` parameters
- Import logic now: checks existing periods, compares quality scores, skips if existing is higher priority, updates if replace_existing=True, respects override_yahoo flag
- JavaScript dialog shows conflicts with table of existing periods and their sources/quality scores
- Import results show: imported count, updated count, skipped count

#### Task 1.3: Create Import from Yahoo Finance ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Details:**
- Function: `import_from_yahoo_finance(security_name, replace_existing=False, respect_override=True)`
- Maps Yahoo Finance field names to CF Financial Period fields using field_mapping dict
- Processes both Annual and Quarterly data from existing JSON blobs
- Stores raw JSON in raw_income_statement, raw_balance_sheet, raw_cash_flow for audit trail
- Handles ticker_info for shares_outstanding
- Returns success status with counts and errors array
- Button added to CF Security form: "Actions → Import to Financial Periods"

### 🔄 Phase 2: AI Integration (IN PROGRESS)

#### Task 2.1: Create Helper Function for AI Queries ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** HIGH (Foundation for all AI improvements)  
**Location:** `cognitive_folio/doctype/cf_financial_period/cf_financial_period.py`  
**Details:**
- Created `format_periods_for_ai(security_name, period_type="Annual", num_periods=4, include_growth=True, format="markdown")`
- Returns formatted text/markdown with financial data ready for AI consumption
- Includes: income statement summary, balance sheet key items, cash flow metrics, computed ratios, growth rates
- Supports filtering by period_type (Annual/Quarterly/TTM), date range, specific fiscal years
- Optional `fields` parameter to select specific metrics only
- Format options: "markdown", "text", "json", "table"
- Thoroughly tested with real and edge case data; output matches requirements

#### Task 2.2: Update CF Security AI Prompt ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** HIGH (Most frequently used feature)  
**Location:** `cognitive_folio/doctype/cf_security/cf_security.py`  
**Function:** `process_security_ai_suggestion(security_name, user)`  
**Details:**
- Updated to support `{{periods:annual:5}}`, `{{periods:quarterly:4}}`, etc. using `format_periods_for_ai()`
- Regex now detects and replaces period variables with formatted structured data
- Legacy JSON field variables still supported for backward compatibility
- Tested with multiple securities and prompt templates for accuracy

#### Task 2.3: Update CF Portfolio AI Analysis ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Location:** `cognitive_folio/doctype/cf_portfolio/cf_portfolio.py`  
**Functions:** `process_portfolio_ai_analysis()`, `build_portfolio_financial_summary()`, `test_portfolio_prompt_expansion()`  
**Details:**
- Implemented `build_portfolio_financial_summary()` generating: total revenue, weighted gross/operating/net margins (properly scaled from stored decimals), total operating & free cash flow, average ROE, average debt/equity, revenue growth ranking (top & lowest), sector allocation block.
- Injects summary block ahead of holdings in both analysis flow and test helper; confirmed presence of lines (Weighted Gross Margin, Growth Ranking, Sector Allocation) via console test.
- Fixed field usage (`total_revenue` instead of non-existent `revenue`); corrected worst_growth logic; applied percentage scaling (*100) for margins and ROE to match period display formatting.
- Holding-level periods expansion uses existing `format_periods_for_ai()` ensuring consistent formatting across security and portfolio contexts.
- Added test helper `test_portfolio_prompt_expansion()` for deterministic verification without invoking external AI.
**Follow-Ups (Deferred):** snapshot caching on portfolio doc, batch query optimization, extended ranking (margin expansion, ROE ordering). These can be scheduled as minor enhancements without blocking Task 2.4.

#### Task 2.4: Update CF Chat Message Context ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `cognitive_folio/doctype/cf_chat_message/cf_chat_message.py`  
**Function:** `prepare_prompt(portfolio, security)`  
**Details:** Implemented periods syntax for security (`{{periods:annual:3}}`, quarterly, ttm) and portfolio (`((periods:annual:3))`, `((periods:latest))`). Latest shorthand produces portfolio summary plus latest annual + last 4 quarterly per holding. Fallback messages for missing contexts. Regex replacements centralized with error logging.

#### Task 2.5: Chat Period Comparisons ✓
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `cognitive_folio/doctype/cf_chat_message/cf_chat_message.py`  
**Function:** `prepare_prompt(portfolio, security)`  
**Details:** Added comparison syntax for security `{{periods:compare:2025:2024}}` and portfolio `((periods:compare:2025:2024))` including revenue & net income change %, margin point deltas, and aggregate weighted gross margin Δ for portfolio. Quarterly variants supported (e.g. `((periods:compare:2024Q3:2024Q2))`). Natural language parsing of “compare Q3 vs Q2” remains future (see Phase 5.3).
